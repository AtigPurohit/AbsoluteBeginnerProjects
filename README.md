# Learn By Doing
A repo for brand new devs who are looking for great fundamental practice projects. Excellent tutorials and awesome repos welcome - submit your PR (pull request)! Not sure how to do a PR? [Here are some good instructions](https://www.gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request), or you can dm the link to [ssbcodes](https://twitter.com/ssbcodes) on Twitter. 

If you've never contributed to an open source project before, this is a great one to start with! 

A good Absolute Beginner Project:
- **is free** with no sign-in needed
- requires NO previous coding knowledge
- explains everything in detail. It assumes nothing
- is well-written and easy to follow
- has up to date code samples that are easy to copy and paste
- is a complete project from zero to finish...no "Part three coming soon!"
- takes no more than a couple of hours to complete
- is NOT a "Hello World!" tutorial
